<p><strong>The Century of the Self (Full Adam Curtis Documentary)</strong></p>
<p>A new theory about human nature was put forward by Sigmund Freud. He discovered that primitive sexual and aggressive forces are hidden deep inside the minds of all human beings – forces which, if not controlled, can lead individuals and societies into chaos and destruction. This series explores how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.</p>
<p>At the heart of the story is not just Sigmund Freud, but other members of the Freud family. This episode focuses on Freud's American nephew, Edward Bernays. Bernays is almost completely unknown today, but his influence on the 20th century was nearly as great as his uncle's. Bernays was the first person to take Freud's ideas about human beings and use them to manipulate the masses.</p>
<p>He showed American corporations for the first time how they could make people want things they didn't need by linking mass-produced goods to their unconscious desires. Out of this would come a new political idea of how to control the masses – by satisfying people's inner selfish desires, which would make them happy and docile. This marked the beginning of the all-consuming self, which has come to dominate our world today.</p>
<p>Freud's ideas about how the human mind works have now become an accepted part of society, as have psychoanalysts. Every year, the psychotherapists' pool is held in a grand palace in Vienna. Psychotherapists, advanced patients, former patients, and many other people, including friends and members of Viennese society, gather in a nice, elegant, comfortable setting.</p>
<p>However, it was not always this way – a hundred years ago. Freud's ideas were hated by Viennese society at that time. Vienna was the center of a vast empire ruling Central Europe under the powerful nobility of the House of Habsburg. Freud's ideas were not only embarrassing, but the very idea of examining and analyzing one's inner feelings was a threat to their absolute control.</p>
<p>You see, at that time, these people held power. And, of course, if you weren't allowed to show your true emotions – if you were unhappy, for instance – imagine living in a castle, deeply unhappy, or if you were a woman, you couldn't go to your maid and confide in her. You couldn't go into the village and openly express your feelings. It was like surrendering yourself to someone else; you just couldn't. Because they had to maintain respect for you.</p>
<p>Now, of course, Freud challenged this notion significantly. To examine yourself meant questioning a lot of other things – your society, everything that surrounded you. This wasn't welcomed at the time. One reason was that the empire they had established would have likely crumbled much earlier. But what scared the rulers of the empire even more was Freud's idea that hidden inside all human beings were dangerous instinctual drives.</p>
<p>Freud had developed a method he called psychoanalysis. By analyzing dreams and using free association, he had unearthed what he described as powerful sexual and aggressive forces. These forces were remnants of our animal past – feelings we had repressed because they were considered too dangerous. Freud devised a method for exploring a hidden part of the mind that we nowadays call the unconscious. This is a realm that is completely unknown to our conscious awareness. It's as if there's a barrier in all our minds preventing these hidden and unwelcome impulses from emerging into our conscious thoughts. In 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Empire led Europe into war. As the horrors of the war intensified, Freud saw it as terrible evidence of the truth of his findings. He wrote, &quot;The saddest thing is that this is exactly the way we should have expected people to behave from our knowledge of psychoanalysis.&quot; Governments had unleashed the primitive forces in human beings, and no one seemed to know how to stop them.</p>
<p>During this time, Freud's young nephew, Edward Bernays, was working as a press agent in America. His main client was the world-famous opera singer Caruso, who was touring the United States. Bernays, whose parents had emigrated to America 20 years prior, kept in touch with his uncle and joined him for holidays in the Alps. However, Bernays was about to return to Europe for a very different reason.</p>
<p>On the night that Caruso opened in Toledo, Ohio, America announced its entry into the war against Germany and Austria. As part of the war effort, the US government established a Committee on Public Information. Bernays was employed to promote America's war aims in the press. President Woodrow Wilson had announced that the United States would fight not to restore the old empires but to bring democracy to all of Europe. Bernays proved extremely skillful in promoting this idea both domestically and internationally. At the end of the war, he was asked to accompany the president to the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Bernays was asked to go with Woodrow Wilson to the peace conference. In 1926, at the age of 26, he was in Paris for the entire duration of the conference. The conference was held in the suburbs of Paris, and its goal was to &quot;make the world safe for democracy.&quot; This slogan profoundly affected Wilson's reception and amazed Bernays and the other American propagandists. Their propaganda had portrayed Wilson as a liberator of the people, a man who would create a new world where individuals would be free. They had turned him into a hero of the masses. As Bernays watched, the crowds surged around.</p>
<p>Wilson Bernays began to wonder whether it would be possible to apply the same type of mass persuasion techniques in peacetime. When he returned to the United States, he decided that if propaganda could be used for war, it could certainly be used for peace as well. Because the term &quot;propaganda&quot; had developed negative connotations due to its use by the Germans, Bernays sought to find alternative terminology. He coined the term &quot;public relations&quot; and set up a public relations counsel in a small office on Broadway. Since the end of the 19th century, America had transformed into a mass industrial society with millions living in urban centers. Bernays aimed to manage and alter the way these crowds thought.</p>
<p>To achieve this, he turned to the writings of his uncle Sigmund Freud. While in Paris, Bernays had received a copy of Freud's general introduction to psychoanalysis as a gift. This work intrigued Bernays with the idea of hidden irrational forces within human beings. He pondered whether he could profit by manipulating these unconscious forces.</p>
<p>Bernays formulated the idea that human decision-making, especially among groups, was driven by more than just factual information. He recognized the importance of appealing to people's irrational emotions. This set him apart from others in his field and most government officials and managers of the time who believed that presenting factual information would suffice to influence behavior. Bernays ventured into the realm of experimenting with the minds of the public.</p>
<p>One of his most noteworthy experiments was convincing women to smoke. At the time, there was a societal taboo against women smoking in public. Bernays' client, George Hill, the president of the American Tobacco Corporation, asked him to find a way to break this taboo. Bernays consulted with a psychoanalyst named Dr. Brill, who informed him that cigarettes were symbolically linked to the penis and male sexual power. Brill suggested that if Bernays could connect cigarettes to challenging male power, women would be encouraged to smoke, effectively possessing their own symbolic penises.</p>
<p>Bernays orchestrated an event during the New York Easter Day Parade. He convinced a group of affluent debutantes to hide cigarettes under their clothes. At a designated moment, Bernays signaled to them, and they lit the cigarettes. He then informed the press that he had heard about a group of suffragettes planning to protest by lighting up cigarettes, which they called &quot;torches of freedom.&quot; Bernays was prepared for the inevitable outcry and the presence of photographers. The debutantes, young women, smoking cigarettes in public became a symbol with the phrase &quot;torches of freedom,&quot; implying that supporting this act was a statement of supporting equality.</p>
<p>Bernays realized that what's depicted on all American coins is Liberty holding up a torch. This imagery combined elements of emotion, memory, and rationality. The image of Liberty holding a torch worked both emotionally and rationally, despite its emotional components. The coverage of the event wasn't limited to New York; it spread across the United States and around the world. As a result of this symbolic act, the sale of cigarettes to women began to rise, as Bernays had successfully made them socially acceptable.</p>
<p>What Bernays had created was the idea that if a woman smoked, it made her more powerful and independent. This concept, irrational in nature, endured, making women feel more empowered. Bernays had demonstrated that seemingly unrelated objects could become powerful emotional symbols of the way people wanted to be perceived by others. He recognized that to sell a product, one shouldn't merely appeal to intellect by stating why the product should be bought. Rather, the focus should be on how the product would make the buyer feel better or more fulfilled.</p>
<p>This idea of connecting products to emotional desires fascinated corporations in America. They had emerged from the war with wealth and influence, but they were increasingly concerned about overproduction. The mass production system, which had thrived during the war, was now generating an abundance of goods. The corporations feared that people would eventually have enough goods and stop buying. Until that point, most products were sold to the masses based on need. While the wealthy were accustomed to luxury goods, for working-class Americans, products were still advertised as necessities. Items like shoes, stockings, and even cars were promoted for their functional attributes and durability.</p>
<p>Corporations realized they needed to change the way the majority of Americans perceived products. They needed to shift from selling products as basic necessities to selling products based on desire, emotion, and personal satisfaction. This transformation in marketing strategy marked a pivotal shift in the way consumer goods were advertised and sold.</p>
<p>One leading Wall Street banker, Paul Mazur of Lehman Brothers, was explicit about the necessary shift. He wrote that America must transition from a needs-based culture to a desires-based culture. People needed to be trained to desire new things even before fully consuming the old ones. The goal was to mold a new mentality where desires outweighed needs. Before that time, there was no &quot;American consumer.&quot; Instead, there were American workers and owners. People saved and bought what they needed. The focus was on necessity. However, Mazur envisioned a shift toward wanting things that weren't necessarily needed but desired. Edward Bernays was at the center of changing this mindset for corporations.</p>
<p>Bernays played a pivotal role in introducing psychological theory as a fundamental component of corporate appeal to the masses in the United States. In the early 1920s, New York banks funded the creation of department store chains across America. These stores were meant to be outlets for mass-produced goods, and Bernays' task was to shape the new type of customer.</p>
<p>He began developing many techniques of mass consumer persuasion that are now pervasive. He was employed by William Randolph Hearst to promote his new women's magazines, linking products from his clients to famous film stars like Clara Bow. Bernays initiated product placement in movies and dressed stars of film premieres in clothes and jewelry from other firms he represented.</p>
<p>He was credited with being the first to advise car companies to sell cars as symbols of male sexuality. Bernays even employed psychologists to issue reports asserting that products were beneficial for consumers, often presenting these as independent studies. He organized fashion shows in department stores and paid celebrities to endorse the new message that buying wasn't just about fulfilling needs but also about expressing one's inner self to others.</p>
<p>Bernays addressed the psychology of dress, urging people to express themselves through their clothing. He highlighted that everyone had interesting qualities, often hidden, and that clothing was an opportunity to bring these aspects to the forefront. He advised people to dress in ways that showcased their unique personalities.</p>
<p>The growth of consumerism in the 1920s created a transformation in society. Bernays played a role in this shift, involving himself in promoting stock market investment among ordinary people. His advice led millions to borrow money from banks and invest in the stock market. Bernays' unique understanding of how large groups of people would respond to products and ideas extended to financial matters, further shaping the landscape of consumer culture.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays was renowned for understanding the psychology of groups rather than individuals. He wasn't particularly articulate, nor did he excel at reaching out to individuals one-on-one. Instead, he thought about people in terms of groups of thousands. His approach was to persuade masses, and he became famous for grasping the mind of the crowd. In 1924, he was contacted by President Coolidge, who had a reputation for being reserved and humorless. Bernays' solution was to employ the same techniques he used for products and apply them to politics. He organized a visit of 34 famous film stars to the White House, marking the first instance of politics merging with public relations. This event captured the attention of the press and helped reshape Coolidge's public image.</p>
<p>Bernays had an innate understanding of how large groups of people responded to products and ideas. He used this insight to assist President Coolidge, as well as other ventures. He helped create department store chains funded by New York banks, transforming the way ordinary people shopped and invested in stocks. He also assisted in promoting women's magazines and initiating product placement in movies.</p>
<p>While Bernays was thriving in America, his uncle Sigmund Freud faced financial challenges in Vienna due to the city's economic crisis and inflation. Bernays came to Freud's aid by arranging for the publication of Freud's works in America and secretly sending him funds. Freud's ideas began to gain acceptance in the United States due in part to Bernays' efforts. Bernays even suggested that Freud promote himself by writing articles, but Freud rejected the idea, leading to a strained relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Freud's outlook on human beings became increasingly pessimistic. He retreated to the Alps in the summer and started writing about group behavior and the potential for dangerous unconscious forces to emerge in crowds. Freud began to believe that he had underestimated humanity's aggressive instincts, leading him to view people as a species prone to sadism and cruelty. This shift in Freud's perspective influenced his writings.</p>
<p>The publication of Freud's works had a profound impact on journalists and intellectuals in the 1920s. They were captivated and concerned by his depiction of submerged and potentially destructive forces within the modern individual. This view challenged the assumption that human beings were capable of rational decision-making, a foundational principle of mass democracy. This prompted calls to reevaluate democracy and consider the role of a new elite who could manage the masses through psychological techniques. Walter Lippmann, a prominent political thinker, advocated for an elite to control the unconscious feelings of the bewildered masses.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays found Lippmann's arguments intriguing and saw an opportunity to advance his own career by applying psychological techniques to his work. He wrote a series of books in the 1920s, suggesting that he had developed the techniques Lippmann called for. Bernays believed that by stimulating people's inner desires and satisfying them with consumer products, he was creating a way to manage the irrational forces of the masses. He termed this approach the &quot;engineering of consent.&quot; Bernays saw democracy as a wonderful concept but believed that most of the public lacked reliable judgment and needed guidance from a higher authority.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays' approach to mass persuasion was in a way a form of &quot;enlightened despotism.&quot; He tapped into people's desires and unrecognized longings, appealing to their deepest fears and desires to serve his purposes. By harnessing these psychological factors, he aimed to guide and manipulate public behavior. In 1928, a president came to power who aligned with Bernays' ideas. President Hoover recognized that consumerism was becoming central to American life and progress, and he acknowledged the role of advertising and public relations in creating desire and happiness machines that fueled the economy.</p>
<p>Bernays' concept of democracy was not about altering the power structure but rather maintaining it by stimulating the psychological lives of the public. His methods kept the masses engaged through their irrational selves, allowing leadership to continue unchecked. Bernays became a central figure in a business elite that wielded immense influence over American society and politics during the 1920s. He lived luxuriously in a prestigious hotel suite and hosted parties frequented by influential politicians, business leaders, and celebrities.</p>
<p>However, Bernays' power was about to face a dramatic downfall due to an unexpected human irrationality. In October 1929, he organized a national event to celebrate the anniversary of the light bulb's invention, symbolizing American business's power. Yet, as they gathered, news spread that the stock market was crashing. The Great Depression began, causing a devastating impact on the American economy and destroying the consumer-driven prosperity that Bernays had helped engineer. His influence waned, and public relations fell out of favor.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Crash also affected Europe's fragile democracies. The economic and political crisis intensified in Germany and Austria, leading to violent clashes between political parties. Freud, battling cancer, wrote &quot;Civilization and Its Discontents,&quot; which argued that civilization was constructed to control the dangerous animalistic forces within humans. Freud's perspective challenged the ideal of individual freedom in democracy, suggesting that true expression was too dangerous. Human beings must be controlled to maintain civilization and prevent chaos.</p>
<p>Politicians like Adolf Hitler emerged in the 1920s, sharing a pessimistic view of democracy. The Nazis believed that democracy unleashed selfish individualism without adequate means of control. Hitler's National Socialist Party promised to abandon democracy due to its perceived chaos and unemployment, advocating for a new order under their leadership.</p>
<p>In March 1933, the National Socialists were elected to power in Germany. They set out to create a society that would control human beings in a different way. One of their first acts was to take control of business. The planning of production would in the future be done by the state, as the free market was deemed too unstable following the crash in America. Additionally, workers' leisure time was planned by the state through a new organization called &quot;Strength Through Joy,&quot; which aimed to provide service and leisure activities.</p>
<p>However, the Nazis did not view this as a return to an old form of autocratic control. Instead, it was presented as a new alternative to democracy. They aimed to channel the feelings and desires of the masses in a way that would bind the nation together. Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, organized huge rallies with the purpose of forging a unity of thinking, feeling, and desire among the populace. Goebbels was inspired by the writings of Edward Bernays, Freud's nephew, particularly his work on crowd psychology.</p>
<p>In his work, Freud described how the frightening irrationality within human beings could emerge in group settings. He spoke of libidinal forces of desire being given up to leaders while aggressive instincts were unleashed on those outside the group. The Nazis, however, deliberately encouraged these forces, believing they could be controlled. They did not believe that the masses were bound solely by libidinal forces; instead, they aimed to cultivate camaraderie and delicate ideas among the people.</p>
<p>These ideals were evident in the massive rallies and events organized by the Nazis, where crowds exhibited unbridled enthusiasm. This was fueled by their support for Hitler and the party. In America, democracy faced threats from the force of the angry mob. The stock market crash had dire consequences, leading to violence as an enraged population directed their anger toward corporations blamed for the disaster.</p>
<p>In 1932, a new president was elected in the United States. He aimed to strengthen democracy by using the power of the state to control the free market. This president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, initiated what would be known as the New Deal. Roosevelt assembled a group of young technocrats and planners in Washington, assigning them the task of planning and managing new industrial projects for the betterment of the nation. Roosevelt believed that the stock market crash had exposed the limitations of laissez-faire capitalism in running modern industrial economies, thus necessitating government intervention.</p>
<p>Though the New Deal faced opposition from big business, it attracted the attention of various sectors, including the media. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist, admired the New Deal's impact on American society. Ultimately, Roosevelt aimed to strengthen democracy through intervention, in contrast to the Nazis' approach, which sought to channel and control the masses' desires and energies for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike the Nazis, Roosevelt believed that human beings were rational and could be trusted to take an active part in government. He believed it was possible to explain his policies to ordinary Americans and take into account their opinions. To do this, he was helped by the new ideas of an American social scientist named George Gallup.</p>
<p>In Washington, Gallup's favorite reading was the &quot;Survey of US Public Opinion.&quot; From his office in Princeton, New Jersey, this renowned statistician, Dr. George Gallup, provided insights into what the nation was thinking from week to week. Additionally, Fortune magazine's analyst, Elmo Roper, compiled a continuous record of the nation's approval or disapproval of how the country was being run in New York.</p>
<p>Gallup and Roper rejected Bernays' view that human beings were at the mercy of unconscious forces and needed to be controlled. Their system of opinion polling was based on the idea that people could be trusted to know what they wanted. They believed that opinions and behavior of the public could be measured and predicted through strictly factual questions that avoided manipulating emotions.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's approach in connecting with the masses was changing. People were no longer seen as irrational consumers to be managed by catering to their desires. Instead, they were viewed as sensible citizens who could actively participate in the governance of the country. Roosevelt's re-election campaign in 1936 promised further control over big business, which corporations viewed as the beginning of a dictatorship. Despite opposition, Roosevelt was re-elected.</p>
<p>Faced with this, business leaders decided to fight back and regain power in America. At the center of this battle was Edward Bernays and the profession of public relations, which he had invented. Following the election, businesspeople began discussions privately, discussing the need to wage an ideological warfare against the New Deal. Under the National Association of Manufacturers, an organization that included major corporations, a campaign was launched to create emotional attachments between the public and big business. This campaign utilized Bernays' techniques on a grand scale.</p>
<p>I mean, totally General Motors parade of progress traveling the high roads and fire roads of America bringing to millions of Americans in their own hometown the fascinating story behind modern industry. During the campaign, they set out to show dramatically that it was business, not politicians, who had created modern America, better modes of living were offered. Bernays was an advisor to General Motors, but he was no longer alone. The industry he had founded now flourished as hundreds of public relations advisors organized a vast campaign. They not only used advertisements and billboards but managed to insinuate their message into the editorial pages of newspapers. It became a bitter fight. In response to the campaign, the government made films that warned of the unscrupulous manipulation of the press by big business. The central villain was the new figure of the public relations man. They tried to achieve their ends by working entirely behind the scenes, corrupting and deceiving the public. The aims of such groups may be either good or bad, so far as the public interest is concerned, but their methods are a grave danger to democratic institutions. The films also showed how responsible citizens could monitor the press themselves. They could create a charge that analyzed the reporting for signs of hidden bias. However, such earnest instruction was to be no match for the powerful imagination of Edward Bernays. He was about to help create a vision of the Utopia that free-market capitalism would build in America if it was unleashed.</p>
<p>In 1939, New York hosted the World's Fair, and Edward Bernays was a central advisor. He insisted that the theme be the link between democracy and American business. At the heart of the fair was a giant white dome that Bernays named &quot;Democracity.&quot; The central exhibit was a vast working model of America's future, constructed by the General Motors Corporation.</p>
<p>My father, the World's Fair was an opportunity to keep the status quo, that is, capitalism in a democracy. Democracy and capitalism, that marriage, right? Linking, like, just like that. He did that by manipulating people and getting them to think that you couldn't have real democracy in anything but a capitalist society which was capable of doing anything, of creating these wonderful highways, of making the moving pictures inside everybody's house, of telephones that didn't need cords, of sleek roadsters. It was if they were—it was—it was—it was consumerist, but at the same time, you inferred that, in a funny way, democracy and capitalism went together.</p>
<p>The World's Fair was an extraordinary success and captured America's imagination. The vision it portrayed was of a new form of democracy in which business responded to people's innermost desires in a way politicians could never do. But it was a form of democracy that depended on treating people not as active citizens, as Roosevelt did, but as passive consumers. Because this, Bernays believed, was the key to control in a mass democracy. It's not that the people are in charge, but that the people's desires are in charge. The people are not in charge; the people exercise no decision-making power within this environment. So democracy is reduced from something which assumes an active citizenry to the idea of the public as passive consumers, driven primarily by instinctual or unconscious desires. If you can trigger those needs and desires, you can get what you want from them. But this struggle between the two views of human beings as to whether they were rational or irrational was about to be dramatically affected by events in Europe, events that would also change the fortunes of the Freud family.</p>
<p>In March 1938, the Nazis annexed Austria. It was called the Anschluss. Hitler arrived in Vienna to an extraordinary outpouring of mass adulation. But even as he drove through the city, behind the scenes, the Nazis were systematically whipping up and unleashing the hatred of the crowd against the enemies of the new Greater Germany. The answer was a kind of explosion of terrible hatred against the so-called enemies, against the Jews and to a lesser extent against a lot of registered censors who had opposed the Nazis in Austria. They said, &quot;It's legitimate now. You can do what you want.&quot; So they did it—stealing, robbing, killing. Human depravity, of course, is obviously very near to normal behavior. It can change very quickly.</p>
<p>As the violence and assassinations raged in Vienna, Freud decided he had to leave. His aim was to go to Britain, but he knew that Britain, like many countries, was refusing entry to most Jewish refugees. However, help came from the leading psychoanalyst in Britain, Ernest Jones. He was in the same ice-skating club as the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hor, and Jones persuaded her to issue Freud a British work permit. In May 1938, Freud, his daughter Anna, and other members of his family set off for London.</p>
<p>Freud arrived in London as Britain was preparing for war, and he settled with his daughter Anna in a house in Hampstead. But Freud's cancer was now far advanced, and in September 1939, just three weeks after the outbreak of war, he died. The Second World War would utterly transform the way governments saw democracy and the people they governed.</p>
<p>Next week's program will show how the American government, as a result of the war, became convinced of the worst, savage, dangerous forces hidden inside all human beings — forces that needed to be controlled. The terrible evidence from the death camps seemed to show what happened when these forces were unleashed. Politicians and planners in post-war America would come to believe that hidden under the surface of their own population were the same dangerous forces. They would turn to the Freud family to help control this enemy. With them, the ever-adaptable Edward Bernays would work not just for the American government but the CIA. And Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna would also become powerful in the United States because she believed that people could be taught to control the irrational forces within. Out of this would come vast government programs to manage the inner psychological life of the masses. &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; continues next Sunday night on BBC Two, same time, 8 o'clock. Tonight, the final part of &quot;SIS.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's say a word about dreams. We all have thoughts which we never knew we had, they are too uncomfortable, too incompatible with our entire self to be remembered. Yet, they are often disturbing, rambling under the surface like lava in a volcano. The dream is the Royal Road to these thoughts, the Royal Road to the unconscious.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story of how Sigmund Freud's ideas about the unconscious mind were used by those in power in post-war America to try and control the masses. Politicians and planners came to believe that Freud was right to suggest that hidden deep within all human beings were dangerous and irrational desires and fears. They were convinced that it was the unleashing of these instincts that had led to the barbarism of Nazi Germany. To stop it ever happening again, they set out to find ways to control this hidden enemy within the human mind. At the heart of the story are Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna and his nephew Edward Bernays, who had invented the profession of public relations. Their ideas were used by the US government, big business, and the CIA to develop techniques to manage and control the minds of the American people. Those in power believed that the only way to make democracy work and create a stable society was to repress the savage barbarism that lurked just under the surface of normal American life.</p>
<p>The story begins in the middle of the fierce fighting of World War II. As the fighting intensified, the American army was faced with an extraordinary number of mental breakdowns among its troops. 49% of all soldiers evacuated from combat were sent back because they suffered from mental problems. In desperation, the army turned to the new ideas of psychoanalysis. They made a film record of the experiment using hidden cameras. It says here on your record that you had a crying spell. Yes, I believe in your profession, it's called nostalgia. In other words, homesickness. Yes, it was induced when shortly before the war, I received a children's sweetheart.</p>
<p>It was the first time that anyone had paid such attention to the feelings and anxieties of ordinary people. At the heart of the experiment were a number of refugee psychoanalysts from Central Europe. They worked with American psychiatrists to guide and shape the project.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first came to America, I worked in the psychiatric service with soldiers, trying to rehabilitate them. I traveled on a train from the East Coast to the West Coast. I was enormously curious about what goes on in all those little towns that the train is passing. After my years in the Army, I knew exactly what everybody was doing in the little towns because I saw so many people who came from there. I understood their aspirations, their disappointments, and so forth. It was as if somebody invited me to a privileged view into the inner soul of America. I'm not doing this deliberately, so crazily hawk-eyed. I do believe you, and the display of emotion is sometimes very helpful. I hope so, sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess it's off my chest. Well, sir, to be perfectly honest with you, I'm very much in love. That must be hard. She has been the one person that gave me a sense of importance through her cooperation with me. We were able to surmount so many obstacles. Take it easy now, just talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Good, good psychoanalysts used techniques developed by Freud to take the men back into their past. They became convinced that the breakdowns were not the direct result of fighting; the stress of combat had merely triggered old childhood memories. These were memories of the men's own violent feelings and desires, which they had repressed because they were too frightening.</p>
<p>World War II was a major shattering experience because I discovered the enormous role of the irrational in the lives of most people. I can say that I learned that the ratio between the rational and the irrational in America is very much in favor of the irrational. There is much greater unhappiness, much more suffering, much more disquiet in the country than one would imagine from the advertisements that you get. A much more problematic country.</p>
<p>Victory in the Second World War was celebrated as a triumph of democracy. But in private, many policymakers were worried about the implications of the analysis of the soldiers. It seemed to show that underneath every American were irrational, violent drives. What had happened in Germany seemed to bear this out. The complicity of so many ordinary Germans in mass killings during the war showed just how easily these forces could break through and overwhelm democracy.</p>
<p>Planners and policymakers had been convinced by their experiences during World War II that human beings could act very irrationally. Because of this sort of teeming and raw and unpredictable emotionality, the kind of chaos that lived at the base of human personality could, in fact, infect society's social institutions to such a point that the society itself would become sick.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what they believed happened in Germany, in which the irrational, the anti-democratic, went wild. What was a vision of human nature is incredibly destructive when they were terrified that Americans would, in fact, behave that way or were capable of behaving that way. And they wanted to avoid a rerun of that. So, what is needed is a human being that can internalize democratic values so that they are not shaken. Psychoanalysis carried any promise that it can be done. It opened up new vistas as to how the inner structure of the human being can be changed so that he becomes a more vital, free supporter and maintainer of democracy. Psychoanalysts were convinced they not only understood these dangerous forces, but they knew how to control them too. They would use their techniques to create democratic individuals, because democracy left to itself failed to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The source of this idea was not only Sigmund Freud but his youngest daughter Anna. She had fled with her father to London before the outbreak of war, and after he died, Anna Freud became the acknowledged leader of the world psychoanalytic movement. She saw her job as to fulfill her father's dream of making his ideas accepted throughout the world. Let the center of the Savoy add movement stood and honor because she managed to work herself into that position. She was recognized, not just because she was a daughter, she worked on that. She was rather forbidding, not a warm person. Not an arm taken you could kiss or put your arms around, not at all. Her whole life rotated around the spreading of psychoanalysis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Freud himself had seen the role of psychoanalysis as allowing people to understand their unconscious drives. But Anna Freud believed it was possible to teach individuals how to control these inner forces. If you'd come to believe this through analyzing children, above all the children of her close friend Dorothy Burlingham. Dorothy Burlingham was an American millionaire heiress who, in the 1920s, fled a failed marriage and brought her children to Anna Freud in Vienna. They were suffering terrible anxieties and aggression. But Anna Freud was convinced she could free them from this by changing the world around them. She thought that she could come into their environment, essentially because they were children. They didn't have independent lives of their own. She could talk to the parents or the mother, she could go to the schools, she could influence their real world, the actual external world, to change their lives and to help them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was changed with people. I think that was part of what her idea was. She felt that she could change them from her analysis of the Burlingham children. Anna Freud developed a theory of how to control the inner drives. It was simple: you taught the children to conform to the rules of society. But this was more than just moral guidance. Anna Freud believed that if children, like the Buringham's, strictly followed the rules of accepted social conduct, then as they grew up, the conscious part of their mind, what was called the ego, would be greatly strengthened in its struggle to control the unconscious. But if children did not conform, their ego would be weak, and they would be prey to the dangerous forces of the unconscious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In my father's case, they were concerned that he would be homosexual. So, a lot of their efforts went into preventing or trying to stop my father from becoming a homosexual. Whether or not he would have or did, it's unknown to me. They were stopped because they felt it was abnormal. It wasn't a normal way to develop. They wanted to have him develop along lines that society recognized as normal. Because if they didn't, then you're going to be under the control of forces that you don't understand, that you're not even aware of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The analysis seemed to be a great success, and in the '30s, the Burlingham children had returned to America. They settled down to happy married lives in the suburbs. What they didn't realize was that their experience was about to become a template for a giant social experiment to control the inner mental life of the American population. In 1946, President Truman signed the National Mental Health Act. It had been born directly out of the wartime discoveries by psychoanalysts that millions of Americans who had been drafted suffered hidden anxieties and fears. The aim of the Act was to deal with this invisible threat to society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shocked by the appalling percentage of the emotionally unstable revealed by the World War II draft figures, Congress in 1946 passed the National Mental Health Act, which recognized for the first time that mental illness was a national problem. Keenly aware of the tremendous problems ahead is Dr. Robert H. Felix, director of the vast new project. A primary objective of the National Mental Health Program is to increase our fund of scientific knowledge about mental health and about mental illness. We're not doing this why? Because there are all too few skilled mental health workers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two of the principal architects of the act were the Menninger brothers, Carl and Will. Will had run the wartime psychotherapy experiments, and now he and his brother began to train hundreds of new psychiatrists. The Menningers were convinced that it would be possible to apply Anna Freud's ideas on a wide scale and to adults as well as children. The psychiatrist's job would be to teach ordinary Americans how to control their unconscious drives. Psychoanalysis could be used to make a better society, they said. Psychoanalytic thinking could make for the betterment of society because you could change the way the mind functioned. And you could take the ways in which people did hurtful things to themselves and others and alter them by enlarging their understanding. And this was the vision psychoanalysis brought, that you can really change me, that you can really change people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would change them almost in limitless ways. In the late '40s, a vast project began in America to apply the ideas of psychoanalysis to the masses. Psychological guidance centers were set up in hundreds of towns. They were staffed by psychiatrists who believed it was their job to control the hidden forces inside the minds of millions of ordinary Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Loathe and despise at the same time. Thousands of counselors were trained to apply psychoanalysis to marriage guidance, and social workers were sent out to visit people's homes and advise on the psychological structure of family life. Behind all this was the fundamental idea of Anna Freud that if people were encouraged to conform to the accepted patterns of family and social life, then their ego would be strengthened. They would be able to control the dangerous forces within them. 'When your emotions control your actions, it affects not only yourself but the people around you. And if this sort of flare-up is repeated often, it might lead to a permanently warped personality. You can control the fire of your emotions so that your personality becomes more pleasant. So we expect that someone who's been through that experience was much more insightful, much more understanding, and a much better-regulated person. Regulation includes being able to let go, as it were, to enjoy a football game or a soccer game. A more understanding, rational, but also appropriately emotional person. The regulatory aspects of the human mind would really be in charge, instead of being overwhelmed by our passions and by our darker impulses. That one would be master or mistress of one's own passions.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They just felt that the road to happiness was in adapting to the external world in which they lived. That people could be under attack conflicts and impulses that they would not engage in self-destructive behavior. That they would, in fact, adapt to the reality about them. They never questioned the reality, they never questioned that it might itself be a source of evil, or something to which you could not adapt without compromise or without suffering or without exploiting yourself in some way. So, there was this fit with the politics of the day, and a barrage of emotions is important to a well-rounded personality. But it was only the beginning of the rise to power of psychoanalysis in America. Psychoanalysts were about to move into big business and use their techniques not just to create model citizens but model consumers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Last week's episode showed how Freud's American nephew Edward Bernays had been the first to convince American corporations that they could sell products by connecting them with people's unconscious feelings. But now, a group of psychoanalysts were going to take what Bernays had begun and invent a whole range of techniques to get inside and manage the unconscious mind of the consumer. They were led by Ernest Dichter. Dichter had practiced next door to Freud in Vienna, but he had come to America and set up the Institute for Motivational Research in an old mansion north of New York.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Institute for Motivational Research, a place devoted to the intriguing business of finding out why people behave as they do, why they buy as they do, why they respond to advertising as they do. And this is Dr. Ernest Dichter. We don't go out and ask directly why do you buy, why don't you? What we try to do instead is to understand the total personality, the self-image of the customer. We use all the resources of modern social sciences. It opens up some stimulating psychological techniques for selling any new product. Like the other psychoanalysts, Dichter believed that American citizens were fundamentally irrational beings. They could not be trusted. Their real reasons for buying products were rooted in unconscious desires and feelings. And Dichter wanted to find ways to uncover what he called the 'secret self' of the American consumer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was trying to get out of people's minds the unconscious motivations that they had for purchasing. These could be sexual, they could be psychological, they could be sociological. There could be a demand for status, a demand for recognition. There were things that people couldn't verbalize or wouldn't verbalize because they were too secret to them. They were too much a part of their nature, and they would be embarrassed if they came out and said things like this. He would interview people but not ask them direct questions, but let them talk freely like you do in psychoanalysis. And that was his background. And so, he said, 'Why can't we have a group therapy session about products?' And dictor built this room up above his garage, and then he said, 'We can have psychoanalysis at products, they can actually act out and verbalize their wants and needs. What we're going to do is try a couple of these salad dressings, now let's see what happens.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's our typical housewife. She doesn't follow the instructions, and they could be observed and watched, and other people could comment, and they could talk about it, and everybody could join in. He was the first to do this. This was absolutely the first thing that was ever done. And he had a movie projector up there where you could show advertisements and things like that, and people could react to them, and he invented the whole technique for mining the unconscious for the hidden psychological wants that people had about products. This became the focus group. It was dictor's breakthrough. He concluded that they felt unconscious guilt. The new image being promoted of ease and convenience. In other words, he understood that the barrier to the consumption of the product was housewives' feeling of guilt about using it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dictor's success led to a rush by corporations and advertising agencies to employ psychoanalysts. They became known as the 'depth boys,' and they promised to show companies how to make millions by connecting their products with people's hidden desires. Dictor himself became a millionaire, famous for inventing slogans like 'a tiger in your tank.' Even the marketing of the Barbie doll came from a children's focus group. And so it goes. Dictor was</p>
<p> convinced that this was far more than just selling. Like Anna Freud, he believed that the environment could be used to strengthen the human personality. Products have the power both to satisfy inner desires and give people a feeling of common identity with those around them. It was a strategy for creating a stable society. Dictor coined the strategy of desire.&quot;</p>
<p>To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-gratification. Modern man is eternally ready to fill out his self-image by purchasing products which complement. If you identify yourself with a product, it can have a therapeutic value. It improves your self-image and you become a more secure person. You suddenly have this confidence of going out in the world and doing what you want successfully. When it believes that would then improve the whole of our society and become the best society on this planet.</p>
<p>By the early 50s, the ideas of psychoanalysis had penetrated deep into American life. The psychoanalysts themselves became rich and powerful. Many had consulting rooms overlooking Central Park in New York. Politicians and famous writers like Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams became their patients. They were seeking not just help but to understand the hidden roots of human behavior. We were sought after, Washington was interested in what we think. The important writers, important politicians were undergoing psychoanalysis. It was weird, we had waiting lists because there were so many patients that wanted to be analyzed. It gave us a little bit of this wellhead.</p>
<p>As the psychoanalyst's ideas took hold in America, a new elite began to emerge in politics, social planning, and business. What linked this elite was the assumption that the masses were fundamentally irrational. To make a free-market democracy like America work, one had to use psychological techniques to control mass irrationality. They actually believed that this elite was necessary because individual citizens were not capable, if left alone, of being democratic citizens. The elite was necessary in order to create the conditions that would produce individuals capable of behaving as a good consumer and also behaving as a democratic citizen. They didn't see their activities as anti-democratic, as undermining the capacity of individual citizens for democracy. Quite the opposite, they understood that they were creating the conditions for democracy's survival and future.</p>
<p>The rise of psychoanalysis to power in America was an extraordinary triumph for Anna Freud and her tireless promotion of her ideas. She remained in England living with Dorothy Burlingham. On the surface, it was idyllic. She and Dorothy had bought a weekend cottage on the Suffolk coast, and in the summers, Dorothy's children came from America to visit with the grandchildren. But underneath, things were going badly wrong. Both Bob and Maggie Burlingham, who Anna Freud had analyzed in the 1930s, had suffered personal breakdowns and their marriages were collapsing. Bob was drinking heavily and Maggie suffered terrible anxieties. The real reasons for the visits to England were yet more analysis with Anna Freud. The problem was that it didn't look very good, did it?</p>
<p>Because here you have somebody who's having nervous breakdowns and is having alcoholic binges, and this is not exactly desirable from a humane standpoint. Obviously, you want to help these people, but they also had the wider ramifications. Everybody in analytic circles knew that Bob and Abby were guinea pigs. They were the living proof that this is a wonderful process. It was very much swept under the rug. It didn't get out. These people had so much power and influence that you were very careful. Anna Freud was a very powerful person and you were the grandchildren. She knew a great deal more than you did about what went on in your parents' lives and so forth. It was not something you were going to tangle with and you were a product of the whole situation. But at the same time, we all knew that something was really out of whack.</p>
<p>As she grew older, she became more and more important, politically and scientifically. But you didn't know when to stop. She was a bit too righteous. What she did was always the thing, and she would never acknowledge that she could make a mistake or be wrong. That is my feeling. But the power and influence of the Freud family in America were about to grow even more. Politicians were about to turn to Anna Freud's cousin Edward Bernays for help in a time of crisis. He was going to manipulate the inner feelings and fears of the masses to help America's politicians fight the Cold War.</p>
<p>In 1953, the Soviet Union exploded its first hydrogen bomb, and the fear of nuclear war and communism gripped the United States. Those in power became concerned about how to reassure the population. Committees were set up and Public Information films were made peeling for calm in the face of new threats like nuclear fallout. At this point, Edward Bernays was living in New York. In the 1920s, he had invented the profession of public relations and was now one of the most powerful PR men in America. He worked for most of the major corporations and advised politicians, including President Eisenhower. Like his uncle Sigmund, Bernays was convinced that human beings were driven by irrational forces. The only way to deal with the public was to connect with their unconscious desires and fears.</p>
<p>Bernays argued that instead of trying to reduce people's fear of communism, one should actually encourage and manipulate the fear. But in such a way that it became a weapon in the Cold War. Rational argument was fruitless. What my father understood about groups is that they are manipulative, malleable, and that you can tap into their deepest desires or their deepest fears and use it to your own purposes. I don't think he felt that all those publics out there had reliable judgment, that they very easily might vote for the wrong man or want the wrong thing. So that they had to be guided from above. One of Bernays' main clients was the giant United Fruit Company, which owned vast banana plantations in Guatemala in Central America. For decades, United Fruit had controlled the country through pliable dictators. It was known as a banana republic.</p>
<p>Bernays set out to turn him into a communist threat to America. He organized a trip to Guatemala for influential American journalists. Few of them knew anything about the country or its politics. Bernays arranged for them to be entertained and to meet selected Guatemalan politicians who told them that Árbenz was a communist controlled by Moscow. During the trip, there was also a violent anti-American demonstration in the capital. Many of those who worked for United Fruit were convinced it had been organized by Bernays himself. He also created a fake independent news agency in America called the Middle American Information Bureau. It bombarded the American media with press releases saying that Moscow was planning to use Guatemala as a beachhead to attack America. All of this had the desired effect.</p>
<p>The Jacobo Árbenz regime became increasingly communistic after its inauguration in 1951. Communists in the congress and high governmental positions controlled major committees, labor and farm groups, and propaganda facilities. They agitated and led demonstrations against neighboring countries and the United States. What was profoundly new in terms of what Bernays did is he took this menace to our backyard in Guatemala. For the first time, we saw Reds a couple of hundred miles from New Orleans who Eddie Bernays had us believing were a true threat to us. It was going to be a Soviet outpost in our backyard.</p>
<p>But what Bernays was doing was not just trying to blacken the Árbenz regime. He was part of a secret plot. President Eisenhower had agreed that America should topple the Árbenz government, but secretly the CIA was instructed to organize a coup. Working with the United Fruit Company, the CIA trained and armed a rebel army and found a new leader for the country called Colonel Armas. The CIA agent in charge was Howard Hunt, later one of the Watergate burglars. What we wanted to do was have a terror campaign to terrify Árbenz, particularly terrify his troops.</p>
<p>Much like the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium, and Poland at the onset of World War II. Planes flown by CIA pilots dropped bombs on Guatemala City. Edward Bernays carried on his propaganda campaign in the American press. He was preparing the American population to see this as the liberation of Guatemala by freedom fighters for democracy. He totally understood that the coup would happen when the conditions in the public and the press allowed for it to happen, and he created those conditions. He was totally savvy in terms of just what he was helping create there in terms of this overthrow, but ultimately, he was reshaping reality, reshaping public opinion.</p>
<p>On June 27th, 1954, Colonel Árbenz fled the country, and Armas arrived as the new leader. Within months, Vice President Nixon visited Guatemala in an event staged by United Fruit's PR department. He was shown piles of Marxist literature that had been found in the presidential palace. This is the first time in the history of the world that a communist government has been overthrown by the people, and for that, we congratulate you and the people of Guatemala for the support they have given. We are sure that under your leadership, supported by the people, Guatemala is going to enter a new era in which there will be prosperity for the people, together with liberty for the people.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for allowing us to see this exhibit of communism in Guatemala, your weather, and for dinner. See what Mother has for dessert: banana gingerbread shortcake, just another of the many tempting ways in which this nutritious fruit can be prepared. So now that you've seen where bananas come from before they reach your table, our journey to banana land is ended. We hope you enjoyed the trip. We know you like bananas.</p>
<p>Bernays manipulated the American people, but he had done so because he, like many others at the time, believed that the interests of business and the interests of America were indivisible, especially when faced with the threat of communism. But Bernays was convinced that explaining this rationally to the American people was impossible, as they were not rational. Instead, one had to touch on their inner fears and manipulate them in the interests of a higher truth. He coined the term &quot;engineering of consent&quot; and was doing it for the American Way of life, to which he was devoted.</p>
<p>However, he felt that the people were really pretty stupid, and that's the paradox. If you don't leave it up to the people themselves but force them to choose what you want them to choose, however subtly, then it's not democracy anymore. It's something else; it's being told what to do. It's that old authoritarian thing.</p>
<p>The idea that it was necessary to manipulate the inner feelings of the American population in the interests of fighting the Cold War began to take root in Washington, above all in the CIA, who were going to take it much further. They were concerned that the Soviets were experimenting with psychological methods to actually alter the memories and feelings of people. The aim was to produce more controllable citizens. It was known as brainwashing.</p>
<p>Psychologists in the CIA were convinced that this really might be possible and that they should try to do it themselves. The image of the human being at that particular time was that there was a great deal of vulnerability in every human being, and that vulnerability could be manipulated to program somebody to be something that I wanted them to be and they didn't want to be that. You could manipulate people in such a way that they could be automata for your own purposes.</p>
<p>In the late '50s, the CIA poured millions of dollars into the psychology departments of universities across America. They were secretly funding experiments on how to alter and control the inner drives of human beings. The most notorious of these experiments was run by Dr. Ewen Cameron, head of the American Psychiatric Association. Cameron believed that psychiatry should not just concentrate on mentally ill individuals but should actually go into government. He believed that politicians should listen to psychiatrists, be in every Parliament, and direct and monitor political activities because they knew what was good for society.</p>
<p>Cameron conducted experiments at the Allan Memorial hospital in Montreal. He used drugs including LSD and ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) to wipe memories and behaviors. Cameron's experiments were a disaster, producing memory loss and individuals who could only repeat a phrase. Despite the CIA's ambitions, American psychologists were finding out how difficult it was to understand and control the human mind.</p>
<p>The psychoanalysts, who had come to power in America based on their belief in controlling the dangerous forces inside human beings, were about to face a high-profile failure. It began in Hollywood, where the film industry was fascinated by psychoanalysis. Marilyn Monroe turned to Ralph Greenson, a prominent psychoanalyst, for help in 1960 when she was suffering from despair, addiction, and emotional distress.</p>
<p>&quot;I said you never asked me to dinner,&quot; and he said, &quot;You weren't that sick,&quot; and I said, &quot;Oh, I always said the one is just this child has no frame of reference. In other words, she doesn't know where she is.&quot; What Greenson did was follow Anna Freud's theory. If Marilyn Monroe could be taught to conform to what society considered a normal pattern of life, that would help her ego control her inner destructive urges. But Greenson took it to an extreme. He persuaded Monroe to move into a house nearby that was decorated like his own. He then took her into his own family life, and he, his wife, and his daughter played at being Monroe's own family. Greenson himself would become the model of conformity. Someone whom she regarded as important and how she idealized, if he turned out to be a very gratifying father figure, she, her ego, would benefit from that. That was the theory.</p>
<p>His wife and children, everyone, was involved in strengthening the mind, they were strengthening the agent that controls inner life against adversity, insufficiency, against too much frustration. So that Marilyn Monroe would no longer be a helpless person looking for love; she'd have enough love. But despite all his efforts, Greenson was unable to help Marilyn Monroe. On August 5th, 1962, she committed suicide in her house. The suicide shocked many in the analytic community, including Anna Freud, and high-profile figures in American life who had previously been enthusiasts for psychoanalysis now began to question why psychoanalysis had become so powerful in America. Was it really because it benefited individuals, or had it, in fact, become a form of constraint in the interests of social order? The critics included Monroe's ex-husband Arthur Miller.</p>
<p>My argument with so much psychoanalysis is the preconception that suffering is a mistake or a sign of weakness or a sign even of illness. Well, in fact, possibly the greatest truths we know have come out of people suffering. That the problem is not to undo suffering or to wipe it off the face of the earth, but to make it inform our lives. Instead of trying to cure ourselves of it constantly and avoid it and avoid anything but that lobotomized sense of what they call happiness. There's too much of an attempt, it seems to me, to think in terms of controlling man rather than freeing him, of defining him rather than letting him go. And it's part of the whole ideology of this age, which is power-mad.</p>
<p>An onslaught was launched on the way psychoanalysis was being used by business to control people. The first blow came with a best-seller, &quot;The Hidden Persuaders,&quot; written by Vance Packard. It accused psychoanalysts of reducing the American people to emotional puppets manipulated by business interests for mass production. They did this by manipulating people's unconscious desires to create longings for ever-new brands and models. The second blow came from an influential philosopher and social critic, Herbert Marcuse. He had been trained in psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>This is a childish application of psychoanalysis, which does not take at all into consideration the very real political systemic waste of resources of technology and of the productive process. For example, planned obsolescence, for example, the production of innumerable brands and gadgets, who are, in the last analysis, always the same. The production of innumerable different marks of automobiles and this prosperity at the same time, consciously, unconsciously, leads to a kind of schizophrenic existence. I believe that in this society, an incredible quantum of aggressiveness and destructiveness is accumulated precisely because of the empty prosperity, which then simply evolved.</p>
<p>Marcuse's argument was not simply that psychoanalysis had been used for corrupt purposes. It was more fundamental. Marcuse said that the very idea that you needed to control people was wrong. Human beings did have inner emotional drives, but they were not inherently violent or evil. It was society that made these drives dangerous by repressing and distorting them. Anna Freud and her followers had increased that repression by trying to make people conform to society. Marcuse challenged the social world itself.</p>
<p>That's a world that should not be adapted to, and in fact, what the individual was adapting to was corrupt and evil and corrupting others. He switched the source of evil from inward conflict to the society itself. The sickness of society lay into society level, not at the sickness of human beings in it. If people did not challenge that, then they were, in fact, submitting to evil. Modern psychology has a word that is probably used more than any other word in psychology. It is a word: maladjusted.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we all want to live the well-adjusted life in order to avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities. But as I move toward my conclusion, I would like to say to you today, in a very honest manner, there are some things in our society and some things in our world which I'm proud to be maladjusted. I call upon all men of goodwill to be maladjusted to these things until the good society is realized. I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself to racial segregation and discrimination. I never intend to adjust myself to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few, leaving millions of God's children smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society.</p>
<p>The political influence of the Freudian psychoanalyst was over. Instead, they were now accused of having helped to create a repressive form of social control. Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham lived on in Sigmund Freud's old house in London. In 1970, Dorothy's son Bob died of alcoholism, and in 1973, his sister Mabe returned for yet more analysis with Anna Freud. She went back for more analysis. She was living in 20 Maresfield Gardens in the Freud house, as I guess she did when she wasn't with her husband, and she committed suicide. She took an overdose of sleeping pills in Freud's own house. There are a lot of implications that one can draw from that, and I just think she had reached the end of the rope. Although it would seem to be a very pointed act, obviously suicide is a very politicized act, and to do it in Sigmund Freud's own house is certainly different from doing it in Riverdale back in New York.</p>
<p>Next week's episode will tell the story of the rise to power of the enemies of the Freud family. They believed that the way to build a better society was to let the self be free. But what they didn't realize was that this idea of liberation would provide business and politics with yet another way to control the self by feeding its infinite desires. Feel awesome, you know, not what it means to be blue. Someday you realize, and me, for all those lies, what it means.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't settle for anything less than you can be. Make your life a masterpiece.&quot; This is a series about how Sigmund Freud's ideas about the unconscious mind have been used by those in power to control the masses in an age of democracy. Last week's episode showed how Freud's ideas spread throughout America in the 1950s. They were promoted by his daughter Anna and by Freud's nephew Edward Bernays, who invented public relations. He brought Freud's theories into the heart of advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>What they both believed was that underneath all human beings was a hidden irrational self which needed to be controlled, both for the good of individuals and the stability of society. But the Freud's were about to be toppled from power by opponents who said they were wrong about human nature. The inner self did not need to be repressed and controlled; it should be encouraged to express itself. Out of this would come a new type of strong human being the better society. But what in fact emerged from this revolution was the very opposite an isolated, vulnerable, and above all greedy self, far more open to manipulation by both business and politics than anything that had gone before.</p>
<p>Those in power would now control the self not by repressing it, but by feeding its infinite desires. &quot;What goes on here is the liberation of feeling, in other words feelings, not just memories that have been suppressed. For example, screaming, crying, anger you had persons really angry and they're gonna let it out. No, no, no. I can show you that. I'm an old man. Listen, I can't get all my strength until this today.&quot; Young people would get if they have those feelings.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, a small group of renegade psychoanalysts began a new form of therapy. They worked in small rooms in New York City and encouraged their patients to express their feelings openly. This was a direct attack on the ideas of the Freudian psychoanalyst, who had become rich and powerful teaching Americans how to control their feelings. Psychoanalysts were afraid of feelings. They believed that what they wanted was contained people, very proper, doing the right thing and living a proper life. Reich had a fundamentally different view. He believed that the unconscious forces inside the human mind were good. It was their repression by society that distorted them and made people dangerous.</p>
<p>The conflict came to a head at a conference in 1934 in Switzerland. Anna Freud ousted Wilhelm Reich, and he fled to the United States. Reich's ideas lived on. A small group of psychotherapists had been developing techniques based on Reich's ideas. Their aim was to invent ways that would allow individuals to free themselves from the controls implanted in their minds by society. Their Center was a tiny old motel on the remote coast of California called the Esalen Institute. The dominant figure at Esalen was Fritz Perls, a psychoanalyst who had been trained by Reich.</p>
<p>Perls developed a form of group encounter in which he pushed individuals to publicly express the feelings inside them. He called it &quot;getting on the hot seat.&quot; The idea was that through this process, individuals could free themselves from the controls imposed by society. The Esalen Institute became a center for these techniques, aiming to produce a new self that could lead to a new society. People were persuaded that if they could change themselves and be healthy individuals, a movement might grow that would lead to a spontaneous transformation of society.</p>
<p>The student protest movement in America started in the mid-1960s and targeted corporate America. The movement believed that corporations used psychological techniques to manipulate people's feelings and turn them into ideal consumers. Students accused corporations of brainwashing the American public, using consumerism to distract them from issues like the Vietnam War. The students began to adopt techniques like those developed by Wilhelm Reich and Fritz Perls, believing that personal change would lead to social change.</p>
<p>The students believed that they could change society by changing themselves. They turned to ideas that allowed individuals to express their true inner selves, aiming to create new autonomous beings free of social conditioning. They used techniques developed by Reich and Perls, which encouraged individuals to release repressed feelings and overcome societal controls. This was seen as a way to overthrow the old order and create a new powerful self that would lead to a better society.</p>
<p>In the late sixties and early seventies, thousands flocked to Esalen. Only a few years before, it had been an obscure fringe Institute. Now it became the center of a national movement for personal transformation – the human potential movement.</p>
<p>So, it became magnetic. People wanted to join this stream of exploration. Within seven or eight years, there were about 200 of these centers in America, looking mainly to Esalen for leadership.</p>
<p>Really, since Panthers, but it took on a big political agenda. You could not separate personal transformation from social transformation. The two go together.</p>
<p>As the movement grew, the leaders of Esalen decided to try and use their techniques to solve social problems. They began with racism. They organized an encounter group for white and black radicals. Those groups would be encouraged to express their inner racist feelings, which had been instilled in them by society. By doing this, they would transcend those feelings and encounter each other as individuals.</p>
<p>I started a series of encounters called racial confrontation as transcendental experience. We thought that we wanted to get that kind of black/white confrontation. So you could really get down to see what was between the two races. Not by backing off and trying to be polite, but by going right into the belly of the beast of racial prejudice.</p>
<p>The black/white encounter groups were a disaster. The black radicals saw it as an insidious attempt to destroy their power by trying to turn them into liberated individuals. Esalen was removing the one thing that gave them power and confidence in their struggle against racism – their collective identity as blacks.</p>
<p>The human potential movement turned to another social group who they believed would benefit from personal transformation – nuns. And this time, they were more successful.</p>
<p>The convent of the Immaculate Heart in Los Angeles was one of the largest seminaries in America. A group of radical psychotherapists approached the convent. They wanted to try out their techniques for personal liberation on individuals whose identities were defined by a series of external rules, which they had deeply internalized.</p>
<p>The experiment began to transform the convent. The nuns voted to discard their habits in favor of ordinary clothes. The psychotherapists found they had awoken other forces.</p>
<p>One sister who was a member of the community, she got the idea that she could be freer than she had been before, and she seduced one of her classmates. Then seduced the mistress of novices.</p>
<p>Sue is an older woman, very reserved, and her program of freeing this older woman was sexual. She drove her to the store and when they drove back and drove into the garage, she leaned over and gave her a big kiss on the lips. And thereafter, Sister, who had perhaps never been kissed before, was ready for more.</p>
<p>The effect of the experiment on the convent was cataclysmic. Within a year, 300 nuns – more than half the convent – petitioned the Vatican to be released from their vows, and six months later, the convent closed its doors. All that was left was a small group of nuns, but they had become radical lesbian nuns.</p>
<p>The rest gave up the religious life. They did. They became persons. By the late 60s, the idea of self-exploration was spreading rapidly in America. Encounter groups became the center of what was seen as a radical alternative culture based on the development of the self, free of a corrupt capitalist culture.</p>
<p>But it was beginning to have a serious effect on corporate America, because these new selves were not behaving as predictable consumers. The life insurance industry, in particular, was concerned that fewer and fewer college students were buying life insurance when they left University.</p>
<p>They studied psychoanalysis. The life insurance business, more than any other business at the time, was built on the Protestant ethic. You bought life insurance if you were a person who sacrificed for the future. If you lived in the present, you had no need for life insurance.</p>
<p>So they had some sense that maybe the sort of core values of the Protestant ethic were being challenged by some of these new values that were beginning to appear.</p>
<p>And I was really astonished at what I found. The conventional interpretation, the dominant interpretation was that it had to do with political radicalism. You know, it was clear to us that that was a mask, a cover. The core of it had to do with self-expressiveness. That this preoccupation with the self and the inner self, that was what was so important to people – the ability to be self-expressive.</p>
<p>Yankelovich began to track the growth and behavior of these new expressive selves. What he told the corporations was that these new beings were consumers, but they no longer wanted anything that would place them within the narrow strata of American society. Instead, what they wanted were products that would express their individuality, their difference, in a conformist world – the very things that U.S. corporations did not make.</p>
<p>Major advertising companies set up what they called &quot;operating groups&quot; to try and work out how to appeal to these new individuals. The head of one agency sent a memo to all staff. We must conform, he told them, to the new nonconformist. We must listen to the music of Bobby Dylan and go to the theater more.</p>
<p>But the problem was, few of the self-expressive individuals would take part in focus groups. The advertisers were left to their own devices. There's an elusive real that is so right, and makes you dance. It's a way out of sight. This tasty little square of malted wheat. It's crispy and it's crunchy and it tastes so neat. That's what I'm saying. He's a folk rock with more rock than folk.</p>
<p>And there was an even more serious problem. To make products for people who wanted to express themselves would mean creating variety. But the systems of mass production that had been developed in America were only profitable if they made large numbers of the same objects.</p>
<p>This had fitted perfectly with the limited range of desires of a conformist society. The expressive self threatened this whole system of manufacturing. And the threat was about to grow rapidly, because an entrepreneur had invented a way of mass-producing this new independent self. He was called Werner Erhard.</p>
<p>After some of the stuff that we traditionally think of as being in your mind is there actually in the world, was your movement to that do. How did he invent a system? He started EST, Erhard Seminar Training. Hundreds of people came for weekend sessions to be taught how to be themselves. And EST was soon copied by other groups like Exegesis in Britain.</p>
<p>Many of our health techniques came from the human potential movement. He criticized the movement for not having gone far enough. Their idea that there was a central core inside all human beings was, he said, just another limitation on human freedom. In reality, there was no fixed self. Which meant that you could be anything that you wanted to be.</p>
<p>The thesis of the human potential movement was that there was something really good down in there. And if you took these layers off, what you were going to wind up with was a kernel. Something that was innately self-expressive. That was the true self. That was going to be a wonderful thing. In actuality, you found people who'd gone to the last layer and took off the last layer and found that what was left was nothing.</p>
<p>Yes, sessions were intense and often brutal. The participants signed contracts agreeing not to leave and to allow the trainers to do anything they thought necessary to</p>
<p> break down their socially constructed identities.</p>
<p>If I push harder than you do, I'm in this question. So you better push fast. Now I do it. Push!</p>
<p>The real point to the EST training was to go down through layer after layer after layer, until you got to the last layer and peeled it off. Where the recognition was that it's really all meaningless and empty.</p>
<p>Now that's existentialism. Zen point. It's gone a step further than that. People began to recognize that it was not only meaningless and empty, but it was empty and meaningless. And in that, there's an enormous freedom. All the constrictions, all of the rules you've placed on yourself, are gone. And what you're left with is nothing. And nothing is an extraordinarily powerful place to stand, because it is only from nothing that you can create.</p>
<p>And from this nothing, people were able to invent a life, allowing them to create themselves, invent themselves.</p>
<p>You can be what you want to be. I want you to start to make that sound, and on that sound, create people the world the way you want to create it.</p>
<p>What Erhard did was to say that only the individual matters. That there is no societal concern. That you living a fulfilled life is all you need be concerned about. And people came out of those trainings feeling that it wasn't selfish to think about yourself. It was your highest duty.</p>
<p>For me, I had a great deal out of it. We really want to know who we are. There are things going on. We learn more and more about ourselves all the time. And really find out what makes us tick.</p>
<p>And how we are discovering this out. S became hugely successful. Singers, film stars, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans underwent the training in the 1970s. But in the process, the political idea that had begun the movement for personal transformation began to disappear. The original vision had been that through discovering and expressing the self, a new culture would be born – one that would challenge the power of the state.</p>
<p>We will not let them separate our culture from our politics. We are people, we are all together. What is now emerging was the idea that people could be happy simply within themselves and that changing society was irrelevant. One of the proponents of this was Jerry Rubin. In 1968, Rubin, as leader of the Yippies, had led the march on Chicago, but now he had undergone EST training. &quot;I was willing to die, and I had a martyr complex,&quot; he said, &quot;in the sense that I think we all did. And I've given up that idea of sacrifice, and I'm not as overwhelmingly moved by injustice as I was. And now we reincarnated ourselves from within.&quot; Basically, the politics were lost and totally replaced by this lifestyle and the desire to go deeper and deeper into the self. By now, a grandiose sense of the self. My good friend and one of the original Yippie founders, Jerry Rubin, definitely moved in that direction, and I think he was beginning to buy into the notion that he could be happy and fully self-developed on his own. Socialism in one person, yes. Was he alive? Well, although that, of course, is capitalism. That's the whole joke. I think it's funny. I think it's funny because people spend so much of their life being bedeviled by their past and being locked into their past and being limited by their past, and there's an enormous freedom from that. Letting people create themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;It helped me to stop living in the past and start building from today and using my experiences in a positive way to be a better person today and tomorrow. But then the problem comes – well, how do you be self-expressive?&quot; And it was at this point that American capitalism decided it was going to step in and help these new individuals to express themselves and, in the process, make a lot of money. The first thing they were going to do was to find a way of getting inside their heads to discover what these new beings wanted in order to be themselves. This came not from Madison Avenue but from one of the most powerful scientific research institutes in America – Stanford Research Institute in California. In 1978, a group of economists and psychologists at SRI decided to find a way to read, measure, and fulfill the desires of these new unpredictable consumers. The idea was to create a rigorous tool for measuring a whole range of desires, wishes, values that, prior to that time, had been kind of overlooked. They say in business, you know, what gets measured gets done. We were basically telling manufacturers if you're really going to satisfy not just the basic needs but individuated wants, whims, and desires of more highly developed human beings, you're going to have to segment. You're going to have to individuate.</p>
<p>To do this, SRI turned for help to those who had begun the liberation of the self. In particular, one of the leaders of the human potential movement, a psychologist called Abraham Maslow. Through observing places like Esalen, Maslow had invented a new system of psychological types. He called it the hierarchy of needs, and it described the different emotional stages that people went through as they liberated their feelings. At the top was self-actualization. This was the point at which individuals became completely self-directed and free of society. The team at SRI thought that Maslow's hierarchy might form the basis for a new way to categorize society, not by social class, but by different psychological desires and drives. To test this, they designed a huge questionnaire with hundreds of questions about how people saw themselves, their inner values. The questions were designed to see whether people fitted into Maslow's categories. The answers were then analyzed by computer. It revealed that there were underlying patterns in the way people felt about themselves, which fit Maslow's categories. And at the top of the hierarchy were a large and growing group which cut across all social classes. The SRI team called them the inner directives.</p>
<p>These were people who felt they were not defined by their place in society but by the choices they made themselves. But what SRI discovered was that these people could be defined by the different patterns of behavior through which they chose to express themselves. Self-expression was not infinite – it fell into identifiable types. The SRI team invented a new term for it: lifestyles. They had managed to categorize the new individualism. They called their system &quot;Values and Lifestyles&quot; (VALS for short). At the forefront of this change were three new VALS groups: inner-directed, I-am-me, and experiential. These groups were seeking inner growth through direct experience. They were in search of new values, breaking away from traditions and inventing their own standards. The corporations were then able to sell things to them by understanding them, by having labels, by knowing what these people look like, where they live, what their lifestyles are. If a new product expressed a particular group's values, it would be bought by them. This is what made the Values and Lifestyles system so powerful – its ability to predict what new products self-actualizers would choose. And this power is about to be demonstrated dramatically. VALS would show it could predict not just the products they would buy, but the politicians they were going to choose to allow.</p>
<p>In 1980, Ronald Reagan ran for president. He and his advisers were convinced they could win on a program of a new individualism – an attack on 50 years of government interference in people's lives. &quot;I wrote a speech about 'Let the people make the basic decisions. Get judges out of the way, get bureaucrats out of the way, get centralized government out of the way,'&quot; said Reagan. The idea that the new self-actualizing individuals would choose a politician from the right, not the left, seemed extraordinary. But to test their prediction, the VALS team did a survey of voting intentions and correlated it with their new psychological categories. &quot;When we said in our surveys, 'Who are you going to vote for?' Sure enough, it was the inner directives who said they would vote for Thatcher and Reagan. It really showed the power of this approach because it's very difficult to identify inner directives on the street.&quot;</p>
<p>These people who voted for Thatcher and Reagan, these inner-directed, came from any walk of life. It's really hardly correlated with social class at all. I mean, if you just go along and look at age, sex, social class, you would never pick them up. But if you really go along with a questionnaire that gets at their values, then you can identify them very easily. And that was completely—you. Yeah.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1981, Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president, but he took charge of a country that was facing economic disaster. The terrible inflation of the 1970s had destroyed much of America's traditional heavy industries. Millions were unemployed. True to his campaign promises, Reagan told the country he would not step in to help as all previous governments had since the war. &quot;These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>But America's ailing economy was about to be rescued not by government, but by the new groups the market researchers had identified. The self-actualizing individuals were about to become the motor for what will be called the new economy. &quot;You can be what you want to be. So, regarding me, what do you really want? A tasty product that's good for me. What do you want that for?&quot; One technique is that we ask people the same question over and over and over again, and we say, 'What do you want? What do you really want? What do you want that for?' And they start to talk about it, and they kind of get intimate with what's going on. What we're doing with that technique is unpeeling the onions. You want to think of a person kind of having layers and layers and layers of protection and thoughts and behaviors and belief. We want to get to that center core.</p>
<p>In the wake of the invention of Values and Lifestyles, a vast industry of psychological market research grew up. And the old technique of the focus group, invented by Freudian psychoanalysts in the 50s, was used in a new and powerful way. The original aim of the focus group had been to find ways to entice people to buy a limited range of mass-produced goods. But now, focus groups were used in a different way to explore the inner feelings of lifestyle groups and out of that invent whole new ranges of products which would allow those groups to express what they felt was their individuality.</p>
<p>And the generation who had once rebelled against the conformity imposed by consumerism now embraced it because it helped them to be themselves. &quot;What capitalism managed to do that was brilliant was to actually create products that people like me would be interested in, that people like Jerry Rubin would be interested in. Capitalism developed a whole industry at developing products that evoke a larger sense of self that seemed to agree with us that the self was infinite, that you could be anything you wanted to be. That took our philosophy and agreed with it and then created products that supposedly helped you—ads that helped you be this limitless self. The product sells you a way of life, a way of being. The product sells you values—you dress this way, you live in a house like this, you have furniture like this, you use this computer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This vast range of new desires fitted perfectly with changes in industrial production. Computers now allowed manufacturers to economically produce short runs of consumer goods. The old restrictions of mass production disappeared, as did the worry that had bedeviled corporate America ever since mass production had been invented: that they would produce too many goods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With the new self, consumer desire seemed to have no limit. In the United States, the concern of companies was always that supply without strip demand; you don't hear that kind of talk anymore because you've gone from a conception of a market of limited needs and if you fill them, they're filled, to a market of unlimited ever-changing needs, dominated by self-expressiveness, that products and services can satisfy in an endless variety of ways, and where's the change all the time and consequently economies have unlimited horizons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out of this explosion of desire came what seemed a never-ending consumer boom. That we generated the American economy. The original idea had been the liberation of the self would create new kinds of people, free of social constraint. That radical change had happened, but while the new beings felt liberated, they had become increasingly dependent for their identity on business. The corporations had realized that it was in their interests to encourage people to feel that they were unique individuals and then offer them ways to express that individuality. The world in which people felt they were rebelling against conformity was not a threat to business, but its greatest opportunity. It was, in a sense, the triumph of the self. It was the triumph of a certain self-indulgence, a view that everything in the world and all moral judgment was appropriately viewed through the lens of personal satisfaction. Indeed, the ultimate ending point of that logic is that there is no society, there is only a bunch of individual people making individual choices to promote their own individual well-being.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next week's episode tells the story of the rise of an idea. It has come to dominate our society. It is the belief of the satisfaction of individual feelings and desires. This is our highest paradigm today: we're going to tell you how to get whatever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to live a different life that wasn't available to me in the images.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Previous episodes have shown how this rise of the self was fostered and promoted by business. They had used the ideas of Sigmund Freud to develop techniques to read the inner desires of individuals and then fulfill them with products. This final episode is about how that idea took over politics. It tells the story of how politicians on the left in both America and Britain turned to these techniques to regain power. They believed that they were creating a new and better form of democracy, one that truly responded to the inner feelings of individuals. But what the politicians didn't realize was that the aim of those who had originally created these techniques had not been to liberate the people, but to develop a new way of controlling them.&quot;</p>
<p>According to their social class from A through C to D and E, they might be CPM. I think by these of whether carrying the luggage all year so Jetson no texting all Stockton in the bags like that. I think the native possibly hits her own hair which is here as an indication on a success. Yes, yeah, probably are a skilled worker. Asked Anthea Thomas, skilled worker? I would agree there, yes. I'm certain the contendership all Danton. That's right, little Gaelic. I, you agree them? Yes, we need to see to eating, sir.</p>
<p>When people were asked their opinion about both products and politics, they were selected by social class and asked only strictly factual questions about what they thought. Leaving your own partisan with is on one side. Who do you think will win this war? Come on, Nathan, labor, and tell me which you prefer. Which party do you think will be voting for? List on this liberal everything for the Liberals. And who do you think will be second? And share with you this one. Yeah, the idea that one might ask people what they themselves felt and desired and then give it to Racine as a to the ruling aliens which would challenge their belief that they knew what was best for the public. With evidence in other countries, the United States, for example, where polls will have been used before elections to interpret the mood of the public and then we were people more they want to have unless what they want to have. But again, knew this Covina's be more democratic. I don't know, it's very dangerous ground. I think though when polls are used in their foot but then in the economic crisis of the mid-70s, British industry was forced to begin to pay attention to the inner feelings of consumers as the recession deepened. Consumer spending fell dramatically and the advertisers insisted that the only way for companies to survive was to make their advertising more effective and to do this, they would have to delve into people's underlying psychological motives for purchase. The advertising industry started to bring in Americans to run focus groups with British house buyers. Everyone is a unique person and even though you're a group of ten today, we don't want a group opinion and we want to know your ideas and your thoughts no matter how crazy it might be. Please let your imagination run wild because that's how very crazy things like instant coffee got born. Now can we get somebody this lady to be a kitchen sink and kitchen sink? How do you feel with these things that are being used to clean you up? Well, I've got to feel clean. I've got to be kept clean. I feel that I should hate it if I was all greasy, so I've got to be easy to clean.</p>
<p>Okay, now the housewife is lady. What would you use to clean your kitchen sink? Um, a scouring powder. I'll cause a cloth to apply the things on and plenty of water. How do you feel that you're doing this chore? I'm satisfied. Well satisfied when I have done it. Yes, under my duty. I said it's a job world. By the consumers were encouraged to play up the products from household cleaners to car seat belts. Game was not to talk rationally but act out and reveal their inner emotional relationship to products, which firmly and unmistakably underlines.</p>
<p>And then a politician emerged who also believed that people should be allowed to express themselves instead of being controlled by the state. The individual should become the central focus of society. Some socialists seem to believe that people should be numbers in a state computer. We believe they should be individuals. We're all unequal. No one, thank heavens, is quite like anyone else, however much the Socialists may pretend otherwise. And we believe that everyone has the right to be unequal, but to us, every human being is equally important. A man's right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the status servant and not as master. They are the essence of a free economy, and on that freedom, all our other freedoms depend.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher's vision was of a society in which the wants and desires of millions of individuals would be satisfied through the free market. This she believed would be the engine to regenerate Britain. And with her, a set out the advertising and marketing industries flourished. Their task was to find out what the British people really wanted and then select. In this new climate, the focus group flood, and those who ran them borrowed from the techniques of psychotherapy to delve ever deeper into people's feelings about products.</p>
<p>&quot;We're trying to understand how people feel about brands, how they relate to brands. That is to say, what the brand's personality is as far as consumers are concerned. There are a number of techniques which are very, very helpful for getting to that understanding. But consumers giving crayons to doodle, to express their feelings, to go inside their own head, pull out their feelings, and somehow get them onto paper. Then, these are ordinary drinkers expressing their feelings about drinking Guinness. Here you see a rich, very female aspect of Guinness. If you were describing a woman who somehow to you has that character, what song person is it? Paula Yates used to lay in bed surrounded with magazines and chocolates like a 50s starlet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out of this research, the marketers began to detect a new individualism, in particular among those who had voted conservative for the first time in 1979. They no longer wanted to be seen as part of social classes, but to express themselves. And crucial to this, when the products they chose to buy. We identified that there was this trend towards what might be called individualism. Where people wanted to still be part of a crowd but to express themselves as individuals within it. To have their own personalities, to be, I suppose, their own men. I didn't want to be the same as everybody else. I wanted it to be a little bit different, a little bit individual. It's quite individual upstairs. It's not remarkable, but I think it's quite individual. It is expensive Italian, it's Italian, it's expensive, it's good quality, it's different. Yeah, we want to sit around standards so nobody else has got what we've got. We just didn't want it to be the same as everybody else. This might be different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Business responded eagerly to this new individualism. It soon became one of the main forces driving the growing consumer boom in Britain. Using the data from the focus groups, manufacturers created new ranges of products that allowed people to express their individuality. Business also recategorized people. They were no longer divided by social class but by their inner psychological needs. If the primary need is security and belonging, the core, the group's mainstreamers, and its status and the esteem of others, that it's a spirals. If it's control, it's succeeded. And if it's self-esteem, it's reformers. And this new marketing culture began to take over the institutions previously dominated by a patrician elite. In particular, the world of journals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The assault was led by the profession of public relations. In the past, PR had been seen as seedy and corrupt. But now it became a glamorous business promoting products and celebrities. One of the rising stars was another member of the Freud family, Matthew, the son of the liberal MP Clement Freud. And other PRs realized that they could use their celebrities as levers to infiltrate advertising into the editorial content of newspapers. The newspapers were offered exclusive interviews with celebrities, but only if they also agreed to mention products made by Freud's corporate clients in terms dictated by the company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened with Freud's was that you effectively got some kind of product placement or even product. The manufacturers of the product got some degree of control over how their products would appear in print. So, if, for example, you did want to write about Caprice's obsession with stuffed crust pizza, you would sign a contract which guaranteed that you wouldn't mention the firm Pizza Hut in at least twice in certain positions in the introductory paragraph of the article. You would agree to run the Pizza Hut logo at such-and-such a size in such and such a place. And of course, that you would agree to run the enclosed pictures of Caprice eating her stuffed crust pizza. There was no choice about how you would run this article in the press. You were effectively told how to run the article in the press by Freud's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a rise of the corporate culture and the rise of business to traditional journalists. This infiltration of advertising into the editorial pages was a corruption of their profession. But to Mrs. Thatcher's allies like Rupert Murdoch, who owned the Sun and the Times, it was part of a democratic revolution against an arrogant elite who had too long ignored the feelings of the masses. They hate to sit on communicating with the masses. They feel that newspapers, the written word, is not for the masses. That should be left to television or perhaps to nobody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very proud of the Sun. And that the Sun was not represented tonight in your film. You just took page 3, which you seem so fascinated with, about page 1, page 2. Every other page of the paper was a typical piece of slanting and elitism by the BBC, who, after all, in order to give viewers for this program, put on a very sexy episode of Star Trek, which you're watching out in the room there. I don't think they put it on to get us viewers. I think we're just lucky to be covered in Carey. Give it into these show use you. So, it's done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the late '80s, Mrs. Thatcher and her allies in advertising and the media had brought the desires of the individual to the center of society. As the last week's episode showed, which was the same transformation President Reagan had brought about in America. Both politicians encouraged business to take over from government the role of fulfilling the needs of the people. In the process, consumers were encouraged to see the satisfaction of their desires as the overriding priority. To Thatcher and Reagan, this was a new and better form of democracy. But to their opponents in the parties of the left, they had summoned up the most selfish and greedy aspects of human nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher both embraced an economic philosophy that says the unit of judgment was not only the individual, but it was the individual's personal satisfaction, the individual's own unique happiness and well-being. It was, in a sense, the triumph of regarding individuals as purely emotional beings who have needs and wants and desires that need to be satisfied and can be satisfied unconsciously. It goes way back to the early part of the 20th century to Freud, to notions of</p>
<p> the unconscious. The assumptions that we are, in terms of our rational minds, we're little corks bobbing around on this great sea of hopes and fears and desires of which we are only dimly aware. And that the role of a marketer, the role of somebody selling something, including a politician, is to appeal to this great swamp of desire, of unconscious desire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The left believed the opposite. The way to create a better society was not to treat people as emotional isolated individuals, but to persuade them to realize that they had common interests with others. To help them rise above their individual feelings and fears. Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This idea had flourished in America in the depression of the 1930s. President Roosevelt, faced with the chaos caused by the Wall Street Crash, encouraged Americans to join together in trade unions, to set up consumer groups, and to pay for a welfare system for those trapped in poverty. His aim was to create a collective awareness which would become a powerful weapon against the unfettered power of capitalism, which had caused the crisis. That idea had driven the Democratic Party for 50 years. But now, Roosevelt's inheritors railed vainly against the effects of the self-interest encouraged by President Reagan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see. Maybe, Mr. President, if you stopped in at a shelter in Chicago and spoke to the homeless there. Maybe, Mr. President, if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we couldn't afford. The Euro, the worst thing Ronald Reagan did was to make the denial of compassion respectable. He said, 'You've worked hard, you've made your money. You shouldn't have to feel guilty about refusing to throw it away on people who choose to be homeless and who choose not to work.' That's what he said. He said it with an elegance and a kind of benign aspect that disguised its harshness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can do anything about it, well why not? If we can work together now to look after the lives of the people here, I don't see why we couldn't work together afterwards to clean up the mess and help build a better world in which these things can't possibly happen. The qualities we've learned from comradeship and common suffering are not going to be wasted after this war. It's out of experience like ours that the new world will be built.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That same idea of marshaling the collective force of the masses to challenge the entrenched power of wealth and business, it also led the Labour Party to power in Britain after the war. But in the 80s, Labour, like the Democrats in America, lost election after election as millions who had once voted for them switched their allegiance to the Conservatives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is going blue just about everywhere. Sweeping the country were powerful regular for the party of yesterday and tomorrow is ours. In the face of this, a growing number within the Labour Party became convinced that if they were ever to regain power, Labour would have to come to terms with the new individuals. One of them was an advertising executive called Philip Gould, who had been a lifelong Labour supporter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gould believed that Labour's leadership had become corrupted by the same patrician arrogance that dominated all Britain's institutions. They denigrated and disapproved of the new aspirations of working-class voters. Labour stopped listening to these people and I remember the best example of this was after the election of 1983, which was the election above all whether people's voices just were not heard. And I had dinner with a leading Labour Party figure, had been involved in the defeat, heavily involved in the defeat, and his wife said, 'God, these working-class people, these working-class people, they just, you know, we give them education, we give them chances in life, what are they doing? They read the Sun and they just don't vote for us.' And there was such a gap between these people just trying to make lives for themselves better lives for themselves, and the kind of elitism of the Labour Party, that was just such a chasm that had to be filled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gould became part of a small group of modernizers centered around Peter Mandelson. Their aim was to reconnect Labour with the lost voters. To do this, Gould turned to the technique he knew well from his work in advertising, the focus group. Full commission focus groups in suburban areas across the country, the small groups of voters who had switched to Mrs. Thatcher. People were encouraged not to talk rationally about policies, but to express their underlying feelings. And what Gould discovered was a fundamental shift in people's relationship to politics. They no longer saw themselves as part of any group, but as individuals who could demand things from politicians in return for paying taxes, just as business had taught them to do as consumers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I found that the people had become consumers. People now wanted to have, you know, politics and life on their own terms. I mean, not just in politics, but in all aspects of life too. People see themselves as they are, as autonomous powerful individuals who are entitled to be respected, who are entitled to have the best. Not just in, you know, going to Tesco's or wherever, but the best in terms of health and in education too. All this was about getting the Labour Party to understand that people really, really, really have changed. And the Labour Party had not, initially, a body change. It would not win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Philip Gould now set out to try and persuade the Labour Party that they would have to make concessions to what he called the new aspirational classes. He was going to face implacable opposition. In the run-up to the 1992 election, Gould argued that the only way to win was for Labour to promise not to put up taxes. But the Shadow Chancellor, John Smith, angrily refused. Labour would stick to its fundamental policies. They would fight the election with the promise of tax increases to create a fairer society. But as the campaign began, it seemed as if Philip Gould was wrong. The traditional polls consistently showed Labour ahead despite the Conservative campaign message that the Labour government would put up taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the Conservative's oldest allies in the press became convinced that by harping on about tax, the Conservatives were cutting their own throats. The way Tories must be but they're not at the moment conveying a sense of rip and being in control. And unless they can do better than that and I think they're going to lose, it is the other thing is that they still say that they are going to go on and on with this one single message of tax. And I think part of the difficulty this morning was that you had a whole lot of people who've been going to the same press conference for seven days, had virtually the same message thrust at them and I kind of getting bored and restless and hitting back on them. I think the media sent a big story coming in, the Tory is being defeated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;John Major's victory in 1992 was a disaster for the Labour Party. A small group of reformers centered around Peter Mandelson and Philip Gould were convinced that the only way for the party to survive was to change its basic policies. But their ideas were rejected by John Smith, who had now become leader. Philip Gould left Britain to go to work for the campaign to elect Bill Clinton president in America. The 1992 election, during it and afterwards, people felt under great strain and really did feel demoralized and dejected. And then to go from this to the Clinton campaign, it was an extraordinary experience because here suddenly I found articulated many of the ideas that I'd had but not fully myself been able to encapsulate or to articulate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want a president who will restore the middle class, proclaim the future for the middle class, and restore the American Dream? Vote for Bill Clinton in New Hampshire and send a signal to the country that we are coming together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Gould discovered is that like the Labour Party, the Democrats had also been doing focus groups with swing voters. The difference was that Bill Clinton had decided to tailor his policies to fit with these voters' desires, above all with their ferocious belief that they should only pay tax for things that benefited them, not for the welfare of others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea what percentage of my tax dollars go to welfare. But even if it's a minuscule percentage, you know, even if it's a quarter of a percent, you know, it's still too much for the people that are receiving these benefits that are basically non-productive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Clinton team decided that to win, they had to promise tax cuts for these suburban voters. And they also used the focus groups throughout the campaign to check every appearance, speech, and policy with them for their approval. What Clinton called 'The Forgotten Middle Class' became central figures in a new type of reactive politics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Candidates for the presidency of the United States had been prepackaged and designed for many, many years. What was new was an attempt to use very sophisticated or pseudo-sophisticated techniques to plumb the public psychology, to find out precisely what the desires of the individuals were, and then to come up with a candidate, a platform, and images and words that exactly responded to those deep desires. This was packaging at a new level. This was polling at an extreme.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'The middle class needs a break. Government is in the way. It's taken more of your money and giving you less in return. In the name of the hardworking Americans who make up our forgotten middle class, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They focus, talk about things that matter to people, you know, 'It's the economy, stupid.' Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Clinton's campaign team, led by James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, did not believe that they were capitulating to the selfish desires of the middle classes. Tax cuts were the price they had to pay to regain power. But once in power, they would still fulfill traditional Democratic policies and help the poor who had been neglected under Reagan, above all with the reform of healthcare.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They would pay for the tax cuts by cutting defense spending and increasing taxes on the very rich. In this way, they believed they were forging a coalition of the new and the old voters, both of whom could be satisfied, probably for the first time in a generation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow, we're gonna win and that means that more people are gonna have better jobs, people are gonna pay a little less for healthcare, get better care, and more kids are going to go to better schools. So thanks, but the Democrats' optimism was to be short-lived.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In November 1992, Clinton was triumphantly elected president, but within weeks, his administration discovered that the budget deficit is far greater than they had anticipated.</p>
<p>At a meeting in the White House in January 1993, the head of the Federal Reserve told them that the deficit was nearly 300 billion dollars. There was no way they could borrow any more without panicking the markets and causing a crisis. The only way to pay for the proposed tax cuts would be to cut government spending, not just on defense but on welfare.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clinton was faced with a choice between the old politics and the new, and he chose the old. The tax cuts were dropped, and he tried to inspire the country with the old Democratic ideal of government spending to help the poor and disadvantaged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to talk with you about what government can do, because I believe government must do more to put people to work. Now, to create a half a million jobs, jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Health care reform sounds like a great idea to me.' 'Well, I know, but some of these details should scare the heck out of me.' 'Like what?' 'Well, like at the start of the Clinton administration, many of us, including, I believe, President Clinton himself, reverted back to an older tradition, tried to lift the public, to talk about genuine ideals beyond the individual, and that reform agenda being not only universal health care and child care and dealing with widening inequalities in our society and homelessness, many things that many citizens, just particularly middle-income citizens, didn't want to deal with.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the suburban voters who had been promised tax cuts were not inspired by Bill Clinton's vision. They felt betrayed and wanted revenge. Their opportunity came in 1994 with the congressional elections. The Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, promised huge tax cuts and to dismantle the welfare state.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The voters who had defected to Clinton switched sides yet again, and the Republicans won both houses of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Announcer: 'Well, I think it's a tremendous vote in favor of smaller government, lower taxes, in the sense renewal of the Thatcher-Reagan tradition, and that's a pretty decisive it means that the welfare state is going to be less hospitable for people who are not willing to take responsibility for their own situation. No question about it. I think this today is the beginning of the end of the welfare state.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For Clinton, it was a disaster. Faced with a hostile Congress, there was no way for him to get his reforms through. His personal popularity plummeted, and it seemed certain he would not be reelected in two years' time. In desperation and without telling his cabinet, Clinton turned for help to one of America's most ruthless political strategists, Dick Morris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morris: 'What did he want you to do, save his butt?'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morris: 'Clinton was in serious trouble. He had lost the '94 election, he had lost control of Congress, and he hired me to come back and help save him. So, he was basically asking me to perform roughly the same role as a life preserver would if you'd rappin'.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Morris told him was that to win reelection, he would have to transform the very nature of politics. The crucial swing voters in the suburbs now thought and behaved like consumers. The only way to win them back was to forget all ideology and instead turn politics into a form of consumer business.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton must try to identify their personal desires and whims and then promise to film if he followed those consumer rules they would follow him.</p>
<p>I said that I felt the most important thing for him to do it was to bring to the political system the same consumer rules philosophy that we that the business community has because I think politics needs to be as responsive to the whims and the desires of the marketplace as businesses and should needs to be a sensitive to the bottom-line profit so votes as a business is I think that all of this involves really a changed view of the voters so that instead of treating them as targets you treat them as owners instead of treating them as someone something that you can manipulate you treat them as something you need to learn from and instead of feeling that you can stay in one place and you can manipulate the voters you need to learn what they want and move yourself to accommodate to get inside the minds of the swing voters Morris brought lifestyle marketing into politics for the first time he went to one of America's most prominent market research firms called Palin churn and Commission what they called a neuro personality poll it was a massive survey of hundreds of thousands of voters but the only political questions at all most were to find out whether someone was a swing voter or not all the other questions with intimate psychological ones designed to see whether swing voters fell into identifiable psychological types well we were asking people like you know do you think you're the life of the party do you think when you when you see things that you like to have a list and organized do you do you typically you know try to plan things ahead or do you like to be more spontaneous where do you like to go what sports do you like to play what would you do with your spouse in a romantic weekend so we were asking people some very personal questions about their own lives to try to see were the kinds of people that were likely to change their vote also possessing of certain kinds of personality traits and in fact they were the neuro personality poll allowed the Clinton team to segment swing voters into different lifestyle types they were given names like pools and patios or caps and gowns who were urban intellectuals living in university towns from this the team could identify ways in which they could make individuals feel more secure in their chosen lifestyles just as business had learned to do with products.</p>
<p>Dick morris called its small-bore politics tiny details of people's lives and personal anxieties which politics had never even thought about or noticed before who which now have become the key to winning power.</p>
<p>It was an America that focused on day-to-day practical concerns should I wear seatbelts should I stop smoking should I wear a school uniform is my neighborhood being protected it was a not so much a new individualism as the social order as we have known it had broken down so we got into people's heads understood their psychology about lifestyle about values what they thought was important what issues they wanted politicians and particularly the President to address and these issues prove to be very very different from what the conventional wisdom had suggested as the election campaign began Clinton revealed Morris's new approach to a shocked White House all traditional policies were to be dropped instead he would concentrate exclusively on policies that targeted the Warriors of the swing voters v-chips would be fitted into televisions to prevent children from watching pornography and mobile phones will be fitted into school buses to make parents feel more secure Dick Morris also persuaded the President to spend his leisure time in the same way as particular groups of swing voters he sent Clinton on a hunting holiday dressed in exactly the Gortex outfits a group called Big Sky families lacked the aim was to reflect swing voters lifestyles back to them the Liberals in Clinton's cabinet hated this approach I would say well a dick why have a campaign this was the 1996 campaign if all the president is going to do is offer up these little bite-size miniature initiatives that appeal to people's desires like consumers buying soap ivy chips that you could put in your televisions so you could make sure that your children did not have pornography and and school uniforms why talk about them they're so mundane and they're so tiny and he would say back if we don't do this we may not get reelected and I would say what's the point of getting getting reelected if you have no mandate to do anything when you're reelected and he'd say what's the point of having a mandate if you can't get reelected isn't the ultimate goal getting reelected but Morris's new politics were an extraordinary success Clinton's ratings among the swing voters began to soar and Dick Morris along with the marketeer mark Penn took effective charge of making White House policy mark Penn set up a huge call center in an office block in Denver and every night hundreds of telephone operators called swing voters in suburbs across the country to check with them every detail of policies that Clinton was proposing the policy was made by a group of people manning telephones in Denver Colorado placing calls to voters in places like Westchester and Pasadena and asking them what they wanted from their government and asking them very specifically about specific policies that Bill Clinton was considering would you be more likely to support him if he offered this particular government service or if he offered that one those people told them what they thought mark Penn transmitted that to Bill Clinton and it came out of his mouth so essentially it was suburbanite voters suburban voters in the 90s were creating American domestic policy and some of its foreign policy as well.</p>
<p>Yeah mark pen was polling on questions like whether we should bomb in Bosnia things like that Morris also insisted that Clinton make a symbolic sacrifice of the old politics to convince the swing voters to trust him in August 1996 Clinton signed a bill which ended the system of guaranteed health for the poor and unemployed welfare would be cut back after two years in order to force people into work the new system was called welfare to work and would he said be a hand up not a handout it was the effective end of the guaranteed welfare system created by President Roosevelt 60 years before for many in Clinton's cabinet it was also the end of the progressive political ideal that Roosevelt had represented the belief that one used a position of leadership to persuade the voters to think and behave as social beings not as self-interested individuals dick morris and the pollsters had won and by that I mean that the people who ultimately got to the president shaped the president's mind were those who viewed the voters as just a collection of individual desires that had to be catered to and pandered to it suggests that democracy is nothing more and should be nothing more then the pandering to these unthought about very primitive desires primitive in the sense that they are not even necessarily conscious just what people want in terms of satisfying themselves and the same triumph of the politics of the South was about to happen in Britain too.</p>
<p>In 1994 Tony Blair had become the leader of the Labour Party in a reforming group centered around Peter Mandelson became old half almost every night Philip Gould ran focus groups with swing voters in the suburbs but this time he was listening to the desires and the fears of the new aspirational classes became the central force shaping Labour Party policy in that period I was talking to people who used to vote conservative from the considering voting labour and the wanted understood that they are financially pressed and that there are limits to the extent to which taxation can be improved they they think that crime is an issue that matters to them and should be respected they you know they want welfare to go to people who deserve welfare not to people who do not this was seen off by many in</p>
<p> the Labour Party as selfish I never saw that it was selfish I believe that in dad or mum doing the best of their family isn't selfish that is doing the best for their family and that's what people do a crackdown on those who make life hell in their local neighborhoods through noise or disturbance what an order is a labor issue today philosophy of campaigning is let's concentrate on swing voters let's focus group them to find out what they want and what will appeal to them and let's just relentlessly push those themes in the election something is happening to do.</p>
<p>After promising to put money in your pocket the Conservatives are quietly Philip Gould was was crucial because he gave the raw material if you like for these politicians to do this kind of politics in that when he came up with stuff they follow it you know pretty much without exception Blair himself would pour over these sort of 12 page memos and say well this is what we must do we want people to earn more to consume the good things of life we want people to pay lower taxes one brand says the Labour government would hold the main tax rates unchanged the Labour government will not increase the basic rate of tax I want to make it clear that I will not increase tax in fact the Labour Party does stamp the middle England those that aspire to do better to get on in life and be ambitious in themselves and their families will do better with labor groups of eight people drinking wine and nibbling you know Cheerios and what they thought determined effectively everything that the Labour Party did and although those running the campaign like to portray the new approaches their invention it was in fact copied from the Americans even down to the phrases that the American market ears had tested on their swing voters Peter Mandelson and his team were in the United States watching what we did and copied almost verbatim our approach in their 1997 campaign the benefit system should be about giving people a hand up not just a handout Mandelson's not a fool it means anything he saw something works and we're not doing and I can remember reading their manifesto and say to myself they just took it lock stock and barrel you know on one hand you're proud and on another hand and as in America labor was forced to drop policies that would not directly benefit the swing voters even if it meant sacrificing its fundamental principles the commitment to public control of industry which was enshrined as Clause 4 of the party Constitution was dropped the aim of clause 4 had been to use the collective power of the people to challenge the unfettered greed of business but now Tony Blair was faced with crucial voters who no longer saw themselves as exploited by the free market they saw themselves as individual consumers who were fulfilled and given identity by what business delivered them the new clause for promise not to control the free market but to let it flourish business is more powerful the government it is quicker it is more creative business is the lifeblood of the country from this how all the benefits society needs employment investment I think frankly there is only one part of getting business right and that's new label what new labor did with suits people who exert power in society not through the political system or not through the democratic political system so it's big business and it suits interests interests me in suits the status quo and you know those three things of course just off the top of my head being the things that the Labour Party's supposed to be you know a counter force to what that means is big business get to carry on exerting their power behind the scenes getting their way because there's no countervailing pressure countervailing pressure isn't going to come from you know 8 people sipping wine in Kettering here he goes selling an awful lot of other blue seats red as well very happy very relieved very exhilarating but those who masterminded Labour's victory in 1997 so it is a triumphant vindication of a new form of democracy their understanding and fulfilling people's inner desires through the focus-group they were giving power to individuals not treating them as faceless groups who were told by politicians what was good for them I don't believe I don't see focus-groups some marketing tool I see the focus group as a way of hearing what would people have to say and I see the focus group as a way to a new form of politics what the people give the people can take away we are the servants they are the masters now 1997 is I think fundamentally important in that I think it is the end the end of the elitist politics is dominated Britain for so much of the last hundred years in 1939 Edward Bernays Sigmund Freud's nephew created a vision of a future world in which the consumer was king it was of the World's Fair in New York and Bearnaise called it democracy T it was one of the earliest and most dramatic portrayal of a consumerist democracy a society in which the needs and desires of individuals were read and fulfilled by business and the free market the World's Fair created a spectacle in which all of these concerns were met and they were met by Westinghouse and General Motors and the American cash register company and company after company presented itself as the sort of centerpiece of a society in which human desire and human want and human anxiety would all be responded to and would be all be met purely through the free enterprise system there was this sort of notion that the free market was something that was not guided by ideologies or by political power it was something that simply was guided by the people's will this was the model of democracy the best new labor and the American Democrats had bought into in order to regain power they had used techniques developed by business to read the desires of consumers and they had accepted Bernays his claim that this was a better form of democracy but in reality the World's Fair had been an elaborate piece of propaganda designed by Bernays for his clients the giant American corporations privately Bernays did not believe that true democracy could ever work he had been profoundly influenced in this by his uncle's theories of human nature Freud believed that individuals were not driven by rational thought but by primitive unconscious desires and feelings and Bearnaise believed this meant he was too dangerous to let the masses ever have control over their own lives consumerism was a way of giving people the illusion of control while allowing a responsible elite to continue managing society it's not that the people are in charge but that the people's desires are in charge the people are not in charge the people exercise no decision-making power within this environment so democracy is reduced from something which assumes an active citizenry to something which now increasingly is predicated on the idea of the public as passive consumers the public as people who essentially what you're delivering them are doggy treats the problem for New Labour was that it believed the propaganda they took at face value the idea promoted by business that the systems invented to read the consumers mind could form the basis for a new type of democracy once in power New Labour tried to govern through a system that Philip Gould called continuous democracy but what worked for business in designing products led the Labour government into a bewildering maze of contradictory whims and desires for much of Labour's first term the focus-group said that the railways were not a high priority and Labour's policies faithfully reflected this but now those same groups are blaming the government for not having invested more money sooner in the railways the point about focus group politics is that there isn't one because people are contradictory and irrational and so you have a problem in terms of deciding what you're going to do if all you do is actually listen to a mass of individual opinions that are forever fluctuating and don't really have any coherence and crucially and not setting context so that's why people can say you know I want lower taxes and</p>
<p> better public services of course they do you know who say do you want to pay more taxes to get better public services people are less sure they then don't believe that if they do pay more taxes they will be spent on better public services so you end up in this quagmire we're doing and the truth is a politician has to say look this is what I believe I believe that you should pay slightly more taxes to make better public services and I pledge that I'm competent of to actually use that money wisely do you want that vote for me yes or no and that's what Blair has failed to do Tony Berto around and sort of tries to feed back to them what they already believe and given what that what they believe is sort of a load of individual incoherent contradictory nonsense and that's all he has to offer and then he wouldn't as why people don't get him you know they don't get him it's because they're looking for someone to do something that they can't do themselves which is actually come up with a coherent political opinion that they might have faith in new labor are faced with a dilemma the system of consumer democracy that they have embraced has trapped them into a series of short-term and often contradictory policies there are now growing demands that they fulfill a grander vision that they use the power of government to deal with the problems of growing inequality and the decaying social fabric of the country but to do this they will have to appeal to the electorate to think outside their own self-interest and this would be in Japan out dominant Freudian view of human beings the selfish instinct Ravine individuals which is a concept of human beings that has been fostered and encouraged by business because it produces ideal consumers although we feel we are free in reality we like the politicians have become the slaves of our own desires we have forgotten we can be more than that that there are other sides to human nature fundamentally here we have two different views of human nature and of democracy you have the view that people are irrational that they are bundles of unconscious emotion that comes directly out of Freud and businesses are very able to respond to that that's what they have honed their skills doing that's what marketing is really all about what are the symbols the music the images the words that will appeal to these unconscious feelings politics must be more than that politics and leadership are about engaging the public in a rational discussion and deliberation about what is best and treating people with respect in terms of their rational abilities to debate what is best if it's not that if it is pardon if it is basically a matter of appealing to the same basic unconscious feelings that business appeals to then why not let business do it business can do it better business knows how to do it business after all is in the business of responding to those feelings.</p>
<p>I see trees of green red roses too I see them bloom funny and I think to myself when I wonderful I think to myself what I wonderful.</p>
