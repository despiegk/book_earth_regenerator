This book is being co-created on a github repository:

- [https://github.com/despiegk/book_earth_regenerator](https://github.com/despiegk/book_earth_regenerator)

It has been created in the following way

- voice recording
- transcryption with a tool called descript
- fixing of the transcrypt
- training an AI system on writing style
- feed parts of each transcryption and fix
- generate images with imagejourney, some skill required to get it going (-:

It was amazing to see how far we got though in a short time.

> This book is written in a very dense form like source code, there are lots of concepts in side which will need more expansion. The book might be hard to read as such.
